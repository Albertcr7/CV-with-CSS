        <h2>Hello.</h2>
        <p class="profile-description">
          I am an Desktop Application Developer. I am a student pusuing B.Tech
          in Computer Science. I ❤️ watching Football and Coding. I started to
          learn code in my first semester of B.Tech, Before this I did'nt know a
          single line of coding. But I found coding so interesting that I was
          eager to start my carrier as a Programmer or Developer.

          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p class="coding-description">
            I never wanted to learn Web-Development because I never knew how
            amazaing it is. Then I started to learn Web-Development and
            currently I'm pursuing the certification course from Udemy. I have
            developed few minor Websites using my skills of Web-Development.

          <h3>Desktop Application Development</h3>
          <p class="desktop-description">
            Since very first day of my coding, I wanted to develop Desktop
            Applications but it did'nt happened very easily because to develop
            fully functional Desktop Application you must have knowledge of GUI
            implementation. SO first of all I started to learn backend work
            using C, C++ and Java. Then by using Java Spring I developed my
            first Desktop Application. And now I can develop Desktop
            Applications using Java as well as Python.
